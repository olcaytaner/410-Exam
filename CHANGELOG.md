### Changed
- Updated PDA execution semantics to match lecture model:
  - Acceptance now requires fully consumed input, a final state, and an empty stack.
  - Made `stack_start` optional; when omitted or set to `eps`, the stack truly starts empty.

### Changed
- Updated the default PDA template to match the PDA syntax format.
- Updated the PDA example in the Syntax Help dialog so it is consistent with the new default PDA template shown in the editor.

### Fixed
- Improved CFG parser robustness by normalizing whitespace (including non-breaking spaces) before parsing, fixing issues with malformed input files.
